# img-spotter

Simple bookmark utility that lets you spot images on a website (with width and height bigger or
equal than 100px) and download them. 

Doesn't work in some websites (e.g. facebook or pinterest) due to the use of the `script-src` [Content Security Policy]
(https://content-security-policy.com/) rule, which only allows JavaScript to be loaded from a list of approved sources.

See how to use it on [https://patillades.github.io/img-spotter/]
